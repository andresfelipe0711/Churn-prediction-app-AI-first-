## 🚀 Business Value & Vision
This project transforms raw telecommunications data into a **strategic decision-making asset**. Beyond traditional churn analysis, this repository features an interactive web application designed for **Customer Success Managers** to simulate risk and apply **Blue Ocean Strategies** for retention.

> **Why it matters:** Predicting churn is a technical task; preventing it is a business strategy. This tool bridges that gap.

## 🧠 Scientific Foundation
This application is the "Production Phase" of my comprehensive research. It is built upon the rigorous data science work found in my primary repository:

🔗 **[Project: Churn Analysis & Machine Learning Modeling](https://github.com/andresfelipe0711/churn-prediction)**

In that repository, I performed:
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovering the hidden patterns of customer behavior.
* **Model Selection:** Comparing multiple algorithms to find the optimal balance between accuracy and interpretability.
* **Feature Engineering:** Crafting the variables that most accurately predict loyalty.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
* **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression (Scikit-Learn) chosen for its high explainability for business stakeholders.
* **App Framework:** Streamlit (Responsive UI).
* **Development:** Developed using an **AI-First workflow (Cursor)** to accelerate deployment and focus on feature engineering.
* **Visualization:** Plotly for real-time risk gauging and feature importance analysis.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Real-Time Risk Simulation:** Adjust customer parameters (tenure, charges, contract type) and see the churn probability move instantly.
* **Bilingual Interface:** Toggle between **English and Spanish** to serve global teams.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** The app visualizes the specific variables driving the risk for that specific profile.
* **Strategic Insights:** Integrated alerts suggesting proactive actions based on the predicted risk level.
